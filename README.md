# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
In order to practice basic concepts and generate a place to store notes for my coding bootcamp, this webpage was created. A simple index.html file creates the structure of the webpage, a style.css file changes the design of the webpage. The script.js file doesn't provide any functionality, but allows the user to see the outcomes of some function practice in the webpage console. This was helpful in learning the basic concepts of webpage and practice the the git workflow.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
